# OCR-IEEE-Project
A computer vision based OCR scanner

Hitbox detection currently can identify paragraphs, lines, and words within. Still improvements to the algorithm required to properly work with lines at an angle.

For now the OCR uses tesseract to check the usability of the hitboxes but a ground up model for letter and word detection is in works.
